#Sources for blackjack rules: https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/
#and http://www.vidpoker.com/blackjack/lasvegas/index.htm

#These sources say that different casinos can have different rules for splitting.
#(i.e. if you split and then receive ANOTHER pair upon splitting, can you split
#a second time?) In this implementation of blackjack, only a single split is 
#allowed.

#Another difference is whether the dealer should hit or stand on a soft 17 (Ace + 6).
#This game is implemented to stand on soft 17, as in many Vegas casinos.

#Adding some sleep(1) statements makes this more fun, as a command-line game:
#it builds suspense and tension

# TO DO (things I would have implemented with additional time):

# 1. If hand is "soft" (contains an ace) it would be nice to make sure the player
# realizes that. Right now, if player has [A, 7] it will say "Your hand's value
# is 18" not "Your hand's value is 18 or 8"

# 2. I realize it's confusing to have both add_card and draw_card methods on the
# Hand class. Could probably take some time to re-factor and clean that up.
